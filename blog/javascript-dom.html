        <h4>How do HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together?</h4>


        <p>Imagine you are in a room. Looking around you see some walls, the floor, the roof and a door. Think of those things as HTML, the foundations of the room. You also see the paint on those things which can be thought of as CSS, which helps colour
            and add vibrance to the room. You see a mysterious switch and flick it on, suddenly the room is strobing with lights and a disco ball comes down from the roof. That is JavaScript!</p>

        <h4>How can we think of control flow and loops</h4>

        <p>This process is similar to following a recipe. You naturally start at step one and continue through each step in order until you have your end result. Now imagine you get to step three and realise you haven’t actually got the correct ingredients,
            so you have to find an alternative. This can be an example of loops, as you will likely cycle through your options, pick one and then continue to the next step in the recipe.


        </p>
        <h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
        <p>The DOM is short for Document Object Model which can be thought of as a big family tree. It holds all the information of a web document and is what links HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. You can access this tree of information on any webpage,
            whilst also being able to use it to manipulate elements.</p>

        <p>When manipulating and changing elements on a webpage such as changing a heading, or a paragraph, this is only changing it for your version of that webpage. Once you hit refresh, the changes are gone and it will be back to its original state. However,
            for our own projects we can link our workspace to the DOM so that when changes are made, they are saved into the code. This saves us from having to only edit in our code editor and is very useful.</p>
        <p>In a developer perspective the DOM is essential. It’s how we link our JavaScript code to our HTML. By using ids and classes we can grab an element and manipulate it with JavaScript. Here are some code examples of accessing an element using JavaScript,
            HTML and the DOM.</p>

        <h4>Whats the difference between arrays and objects?</h4>
        <p>Objects are a powerful data type in JavaScript. They are a mutable data structure which is used to essentially represent a ‘thing’. This could be anything like people, places, cars etc</p>
        <p></p> Here is an example:</p>
        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1hdq0QRmOO1zPS1A3d8qoM5LtxdO-uuwdusu9Kvr5VTXSORuUA4BCzxF1Yjh8zCNb5CJr2KtI49Wd1a4IrG55vT0eMuk8f5Kjr9e1C7-3ntbEpDn0KMpUBhLZpGGhDKLi5s6brE7Jw=w2400?source=screenshot.guru"> <img class="smaller-image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1hdq0QRmOO1zPS1A3d8qoM5LtxdO-uuwdusu9Kvr5VTXSORuUA4BCzxF1Yjh8zCNb5CJr2KtI49Wd1a4IrG55vT0eMuk8f5Kjr9e1C7-3ntbEpDn0KMpUBhLZpGGhDKLi5s6brE7Jw=w600-h292-p-k" /> </a>
        <p>Using console.log(objectName.name) will list ‘James’. </p>
        <p>The major difference with arrays in JavaScript is that they store the data in an ordered collection which uses zero-based indexing. This means that the first element of an array has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, the third has an
            index of 2 and so on and so forth. They are also mutable which means the data can be modified</p>
        <p></p> Here is an example of an example:</p>
        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ecMO7cAmSWdVsF0GqajIa2fIGzGMgp5Df_RC7caKW9FMedUGJf0JlviSm1HLhbC_oeEfpf0AmRkDlwXnT4Qadumzs5iKyLNtKiam0VVGcpaTseUDiS4ff3XFLb61Y6wF_LGX3vjvfQ=w2400?source=screenshot.guru"> <img class="smaller-image" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ecMO7cAmSWdVsF0GqajIa2fIGzGMgp5Df_RC7caKW9FMedUGJf0JlviSm1HLhbC_oeEfpf0AmRkDlwXnT4Qadumzs5iKyLNtKiam0VVGcpaTseUDiS4ff3XFLb61Y6wF_LGX3vjvfQ=w600-h168-p-k" /> </a>
        <p>Using console.log(array[0]) returns 12 as the first element starts at 0.</p>
        </p>
        <p>

            <h4>Functions</h4>
            <p>A function in JavaScript is essentially a procedure. So imagine a group of instructions that perform a task. They are used constantly in JavaScript and when used correctly can save you a lot of time and repetition as they can be used as many
                times as you need. In the code example in the DOM section above, you can see a function at work.</p>
