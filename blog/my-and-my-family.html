    <h1>Me & My Family</h1>
    <p>“Family is not an important thing. It's everything.”</p>
    <div class="text-container">
        <h4>My Family</h4>
        <H5>My Mother and Father</H5>
        <ul class="text-align-left">
            <li>Originally from Bluff</li>
            <li>Grew up in Invercargill</li>
            <li>Moved to Christchurch and had my two older brothers</li>
            <li>Decided to raise our whole family in Wellington</li>
            <li>Now reside in Queenstown</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My parents have always been the most amazing role models. They are both from big families and didn't have a lot whilst growing up but enough to know how valuable even the simplest of things can be. They have always had great work ethics, knowing
            that hard work will always pay off.

            <h5>My Brothers</h5>
            <ul class="text-align-left">
                <li>Joshua has always loved Wellington so has been active in the community, whilst raising his children there.</li>
                <li>Patrick has lived all around the world and now is raising his family in Christchurch</li>
                <li>My niece and nephews are Leo, Lilly, George and Elliot </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I have always looked up to my brothers and have continued to learn a lot from them as I have progress through life. My oldest brother Joshua owns his own successful graphic design company and is the father to Leo and Lily. Patrick is a primary
                school teacher and is the father to George and Elliot.
            </p>
            <h4>Myself</h4>
            <p></p>
            <ul class="text-align-left">
                <li>Moved to Auckland 8 years ago</li>
                <li>Spent the last 11 years working in live television</li>
                <li>Love sports, video games, and swimming</li>
            </ul>
            <p> I have been blessed with many opportunities and have always tried to make the most of them. Myself and my Fiancée are expecting our first child who is due in September and have recently found that we're having a girl! I am so excited to be
                on this journey with Dev Academy and can't wait to see what the future holds!</p>
