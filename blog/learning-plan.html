    <h1>Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>

    <div class="text-container">

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p>
            My long term goal is to be in the tech industry as a front-end web developer.
        </p>

        <h3>What are your strengths and limitations concerning learning?</h3>
        <p>
            I have always been a hard worker and very dedicated. However, sometimes I lean towards obsessing over small things which can have the effect of putting me behind. I have always been a problem solver, so knowing when to reach out instead of finding the
            solution myself will be something I need to practise.
        </p>

        <h3>What non-technical - human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
            Even though I am not a shy person, I would like to be more open about my progress rather than keeping something to myself until I am comfortable sharing. Having the confidence to be more open about where I am at.
        </p>

        <h3>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h3>
        <p>
            I have the perfect environment to study and focus. My house is quiet with a dedicated study room, which means when it is time to switch off I can simply shut the door and give myself a break. I have been trying to stick to the time-box suggestions as
            much as possible while I adjust my brain to studying. My plan is to slowly adjust to the workload so when bootcamp starts I can handle longer hours. If things feel like they are starting to get to me, I will take a break and try to approach
            the issue from a different perspective and/or mindset.
        </p>

        <h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h3>
        <p>
            My friend who is a EDA graduate gave me great advice. If I don’t understand something or can’t find a solution myself within 10 minutes, ask for some advice. I will post questions on the Dev Academy discord or ask a facilitator who is available.
        </p>

        <h3>What is your expectation from the facilitation team?</h3>
        <p>
            To have no judgement based on the questions that are asked, no matter how simple the solution is. Also, to offer advice as to how best cope with being out of my comfort zone.
        </p>

        <h1>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I am wanting to join the industry as a front-end developer. I don’t have any particular destination in mind but I am wanting to use my creative abilities in an online world. </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
            My biggest strengths would be my communication skills and working effectively as a team.
        </p>
        <p>
            My limitations will be the anxiousness I have regarding my current abilities gained through foundations. It has taken a lot longer than I expected to gain an understanding of JavaScript and I still feel under equiped. I fear I will be slowing people down
            while working in groups of peers.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>Deep into my core personality I have always been an anxious person. I have a fear of being the only person who doesn’t understand something. I believe overcoming that feeling of anxiety towards the unknown will be the biggest challenge. Trying
            to find a place in my mind where I am comfortable being in the unknown. Learning to be comfortable being uncomfortable!
        </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
            Learning to only compare myself with my progress and not others. Being more open when I don’t understand something. Finding the right balance between working something out on my own and knowing when to seek help.
        </p>

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
            To be understanding when something doesn’t click. As I have a fear of being the only person who hasn’t understood something, being able to offer extra support at times to help solidify what I haven’t fully made sense of something.

        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
            My expectations of myself are to absorb everything as best I can. Remembering everything I have learned while studying the core aspects of the curriculum. To remember my weaknesses and don’t let them get the better of me. Asking for help when I need it
            and not let myself get stuck in a rut. Not being afraid to be open about my progress. My plan is to revise everything I have learned that day at home. I have a good friend who is a Senior Developer in the UK who can assist in after hours support.
            I will be putting in as many hours that is required while remembering healthy breaks and good mental strategies to cope with the workload.
