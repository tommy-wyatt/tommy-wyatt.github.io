    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

    <div class="text-container">

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

        <p>My long term goal is to be in the tech industry as a front-end web developer.

        </p>
        <h3>What are your strengths and limitations concerning learning?</h3>
        <p> I have always been a hard worker and very dedicated. However, sometimes I lean towards obsessing over small things which can have the effect of putting me behind. I have always been a problem solver, so knowing when to reach out instead of finding
            the solution myself will be something I need to practise.
        </p>
        <h3>What non-technical - human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>Even though I am not a shy person, I would like to be more open about my progress rather than keeping something to myself until I am comfortable sharing. Having the confidence to be more open about where I am at.
        </p>

        <h3>How will you manage your workload in this programme?</h3>
        <p>I have the perfect environment to study and focus. My house is quiet with a dedicated study room, which means when it is time to switch off I can simply shut the door and give myself a break. I have been trying to stick to the time-box suggestions
            as much as possible while I adjust my brain to studying. My plan is to slowly adjust to the workload so when bootcamp starts I can handle longer hours. If things feel like they are starting to get to me, I will take a break and try to approach
            the issue from a different perspective and/or mindset.</p>

        <h3>How and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h3>
        <p>My friend who is a EDA graduate gave me great advice. If I don’t understand something or can’t find a solution myself within 10 minutes, ask for some advice. I will post questions on the Dev Academy discord or ask a facilitator who is available.
        </p>

        <h3>What is your expectation from the facilitation team?</h3>
        <p>To have no judgement based on the questions that are asked, no matter how simple the solution is. Also, to offer advice as to how best cope with being out of my comfort zone.</p>
