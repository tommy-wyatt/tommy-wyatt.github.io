            <h4>When were you blocked on a simple problem?</h4>

            <p>
                I was stuck on a challenge called FizzBuzz where the goal was to write a program that prints out numbers 1 - 100. For multiples of 3 it should be replaced by the word ‘Fizz’, for multiples of 5 ‘Buzz’ and for multiples of 15 it should be replaced with
                “FizzBuzz”. I was confident with how I had written most of my code but still wasn’t 100% sure. It turns out the reason the test was failing was as simple as having the multiple numbers written in the wrong order. I felt quite confused
                during the process with my knowledge being still very limited. This caused me to feel quite frustrated but the way I got through it was asking for help!
            </p>

            <h4>When did you Elegantly Solve a problem?</h4>
            <p>
                During a challenge called Gradebook we had to write code that would work out the average score of students. I found this challenge very tough and did my best at writing each step as pseudocode. After researching the many different ways this challenge
                could be completed and after seeking advice from other students, I was confident it should all be working. As the test was still failing I thought It had to be something very simple. It turns out that I must have accidentally erased some
                'students scores' which I had done earlier on in the challenge. So after being confused for a while and a few head scratches later, it was something very simple. I learned that I should have more attention to small details as these have
                the same results as totally broken code.
            </p>

            <h4>How confident do you feel using different problem-solving techniques/processes?</h4>

            <p>
                I found using pseudocode quite useful as I was able to see each step I needed to follow in order to write my code. The rubber ducky method was useful when I was taking breaks away from my computer but as my knowledge still feels limited, it wasn’t as
                effective as it will be when I understand more. The error messages during the JavaScript Katas were very useful as It stated information about exactly what line the error was forming, or when I was missing something as simple as a curly
                brackets. Console logging was how I was able to solve the problem of not having correct scores in the Gradebook challenge and also made helped me feel more aware of what was required for the Built-in Methods challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                I used google a lot during the katas and was able to find many different ways complete each goal. Though sometimes these didn’t pass the tests as they were quite specific, which caused me to feel overwhelmed with information. However, it helped point
                me in the right direction. I was able to get unblocked with the help of other students at times though I always wanted to try and resolve the problems myself. After challenging times during the Katas I did get good practice at trouble-shooting
                and more comfortable with problem solving methods.
