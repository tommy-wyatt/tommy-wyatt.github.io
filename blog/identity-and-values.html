<h1>Identity & Values</h1>

        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Compassionate</li>
            <li>Kind</li>

        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>

            <li>Perfectionist</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My strengths will play a big role in my career development. I believe they are particularly suited for working in groups. I have learned a lot by being a leader in my previous career so have a good understanding of how to be successful in a team.
            When working with others I will be able to offer assistance to those that need it and help motivate the people around me. </p>
        <p>I will be limited by my weakness until I become more confident in my abilities.</p>


        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>

        <p>My first year out of college I was successful in my application to become a flight attendant for Qantas. This was a huge deal for me as I have always loved anything to do with aeroplanes. The training was a tough 7 week programme before you could
            fly unaccompanied as a fully qualified flight attendant. During this time I made some very close friends, and one person in particular became my closest buddy. Not long after we graduated we got a flat together.
        </p>
        <p> For the first few months all was good; we had a great place to live, worked together, and had a great new career in something we loved. However, about six months on he had a tragic family loss and was devastated. To cope with his grief he began
            to drink more and more. I did everything I could do to help him get through without the need for alcohol but this was a battle that I could not win.
        </p>
        <p>It got to the point where he was drinking every night and began to perform poorly at work. Everyone noticed it and offered him everything they could to help him.
        </p>
        <p>One morning I saw him drinking an hour before his flight. I had suspected this was happening but had never actually seen it. So after confronting him, he swore he would never do it again. A week later I noticed the same behaviour and had to tell
            my boss what was happening. I knew he would lose his job and I would probably lose a best friend. But this was just not something I could live with. It went against everything I believe in.
        </p>
        <p> After telling my boss, he was let go. I lost my best friend and nothing was quite the same again.
        </p>
        <p> The good news is after about 2 years he reached out and thanked me. He said if I hadn’t reported him, who knows where he would be.
        </p>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My parents have always been been really hard workers, looked after everybody around them, and knew the true value of family. Watching my mother start and grow a business that became very successful, illustrated that hard work pays off. Seeing
            how my parents lived their lives shaped who I am today.</p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h3>
        <p>In live television there are a number of elements that make up the overall broadcast. These include sound/audio, media, vision, graphics, producer, director and presenter. The presenter is the face of the broadcast, as they are the personal connection
            between the viewer and the product. In my previous role there was always one particular presenter who was always difficult.</p>
        <p>On one particular occasion everything that could go wrong did go wrong. Sometimes that’s just how it goes on live television and I became used to it as my experience grew. On this particular day this presenter was in a terrible mood. Everything
            is going wrong and the face of the broadcast is in a bad mood. Not a good combo! He was undermining my decisions, muttering rude remarks under his breath, and ignoring my directions entirely. This is an awful situation to be in, so I knew
            I had only one objective. That objective was to do my job as best I could, and if things continued to go wrong at least I knew I did my best. There was a part of me that was screaming on the inside but I had to remain calm, think slowly and
            patiently, and take everything one step at a time. My strategy was to make him feel as though his behaviour wasn’t affecting me at all. After a while, I even tricked myself. I then began to believe that I wasn’t being affected and found this
            to be my secret weapon. I was able to get to the end of the broadcast with my emotions intact and the day was nowhere near as bad as it could have been had my emotions got the better of me. Sometimes changing the way you think can have a huge
            impact and I believe this can apply to all aspects of life.
