        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence vs Traditional Intelligence?</h4>
        <H5>Traditional Intelligence</H5>

        <p>Traditional Intelligence measures a person’s academic competency and reasoning ability. There are many tests available to measure IQ and contain a number of factors including age and cognitive ability.</p>


        <h5>Emotional Intelligence</h5>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor your feelings and emotions, to then use this information to help your thinking actions and processes. Having a good understanding of who you are and how you react to certain situations is also a
            part of Emotional Intelligence.</p>
        <p>If you start to grow anxious or angry in a certain situation, you know how to regulate that feeling based on the knowledge you have from previous experience. Having the ability to defend against self-doubt with strengths and weaknesses will help
            you get through difficult and stressful times in life and work environments.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>The Three Steps to Emotional Intelligence</h4>
        <h5>Mindfulness</h5>
        <p>The practice of mindfulness can teach us to be less reactive. Helps us make wiser choices when faced with challenging situations.</p>
        <h5>Self Knowledge and Mastery</h5>
        <p> Being able to see whats going on internally. This helps us understand who we are and how we react to different situations, then we can practice this understanding overtime.</p>
        <h5>Creating Useful Mental Habits </h5>
        <p>We can create useful habits when we are in a situation that may be difficult and stressful. By practicing these habits we can train our brain to react differently to emotions such as a self-critical mind. This can allow us to find solutions faster
            and in a more productive, healthy manner. </p>
        <h4>What are the benefits Emotional Intelligence and why is it important?</h4>
        <p>Having a high level of EQ is more important than having a high level of IQ in a work environment. You can achieve better performance, enhance your leadership ability and improve your overall happiness. Being able to think clearer and to stop mental
            obstacles in their tracks will help us to perform at an optimal level. </p>
        <p>I remember when working in live television where some shifts were very difficult, and others absolutely amazing! This was all down to my state of mind at the time. If staff were being difficult, things weren’t going to plan and I was feeling stressed
            out I would struggle to preform at a high level. On the other hand If I had a good crew around me, felt no judgement from others and had a high level of confidence I was able to perform at an optimal level. I believe if I had a higher level
            of EQ in my previous career I would have performed at my best on even the worst days. </p>
