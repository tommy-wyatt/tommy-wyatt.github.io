            <h4>What are the new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>

            <p>
                I have learned that thinking positively and believing that I can do better helps with challenging times. There have been many times during foundations I have felt overwhelmed and had negative thoughts about my ability. Improving my emotional intelligence
                has made a big difference to my learning.
            </p>

            <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
            <p>
                Values and empathy help when on a learning journey with others. I was on the receiving end kindness and empathy while struggling with a challenge. At one point I asked for help and explained I was finding things difficult and felt great kindness from
                this person. They explained that it is totally normal to feel this way which gave me my confidence in my abilities back.
            </p>

            <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

            <p>
                I had never meditated before or really thought about how it could be helpful. After doing a twelve minute meditation I was so surprised how relaxed I felt. After this experience I now do this meditation before I start or resume any study as It helps me
                to calm my nerves and start challenges with an open mind.
            </p>
            <h4>What were the most challenging aspect of the core learning?</h4>
            <p>
                Practicing mindfulness was more difficult than I thought. When having negative thoughts or self-doubts, I was trying to train myself to use these in a different way. I am trying to be less reactive to these feelings. I know that mastering this will help
                me to find solutions to problems faster. I was also initially intimidated by the listening and looping exercise. Talking to someone I had never met over a video call seemed daunting, but In the end I actually really enjoyed it!
            </p>
            <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
            <p>
                Because there is so much to learn in programming and having the core skills to handle the challenges that are inevitable is vital for progressing. Having people around you who all share the same core values to help each other is also very important. As
                there is a lot of group and pair work during bootcamp, knowing that your peers will be there for you is key. Understanding how emotional intelligence makes a big difference and how to increase you neuroplasticity is also vital to keep
                up with the constant flow of information that everyone will face in bootcamp.
            </p>
            <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
            <p>
                I don’t think studying the core was a waste of time. I found it very interesting learning about neuroplasticity and emotional intelligence. Learning about how much of an impact a positive mindset can have was something I found reassuring. There were many
                times during foundations I simply thought “I can’t do this, this is too hard!” But after taking a break and remembering about all the core things I had learned, this gave me that confidence boost to keep going. Then once I had the results
                I was after it felt amazing!
