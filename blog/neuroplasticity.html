    <h1>Neuroplacticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
    <div class="text-container">

        <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>

        <p>
            Neuroplacticity makes your brain extremely resilient and is how all permanent learning takes place. Having the knowledge and thought process that intelligence is in fact malleable, will allow people to preform better while studying or learning something
            entirely new. Simply believing you can mould your brain to adapt to new things will actually allow you to learn more than maybe once thought. This is particularly helpful with self-doubt. If people understand that they are able to have more
            control over learning by changing the way they think, this can remove the barrier people tend to put in front of themselves due to what they think their limitations are.
        </p>

        <p>
            The concept of practice, practice, practice is something everyone has heard before. But actually knowing and understanding that this is actually creating strong pathways in the brain, can help people see this from a different angle. For example, when
            thinking of a skill they have such being able to play an instrument. They have this skill due to strong pathways after lots of practice, this can be translated into learning anything new.
        </p>


        <h4>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h4>

        <p>
            The example above about a skill that was gained through practice is especially helpful to me as I have been playing guitar since I was eleven years old. Knowing that if I am to practice enough and dedicate myself the same way as I learned an instrument,
            I can have successfull learning and to also go further in a career. After researching about how much of an impact just having the knowledge that you can mould you brain is very encouraging. Understanding that different behaviour, thinking
            and emotions also have such a huge impact on neuroplacticty gives me even more motivation to follow the practices we learned about emotional intelligence. My behaviour is everything when it comes to rewiring my brain!
        </p>

        <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>

        <h5>Clarity</h5>

        <p>
            To help increase neuroplasticity changing behaviours is crucial. Knowing how you want to accomplish, and why you want to accomplish something is important when wanting to make real long-term changes in the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asking yourself these questions:
        </p>

        <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oS2n4g8I2eEX8rQHRNCElfvy9w_Pd6FvwQClt7Yahg6tYeAr1f3Bhtdiks0bznMQ2X3LRr5D7WEWvg2nOx9h37t9sACBLoPKGwbW3jtq9BXGN8GJBM1i6QJK4RxotOhdJBduIFBV6Q=w2400?source=screenshot.guru"> <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oS2n4g8I2eEX8rQHRNCElfvy9w_Pd6FvwQClt7Yahg6tYeAr1f3Bhtdiks0bznMQ2X3LRr5D7WEWvg2nOx9h37t9sACBLoPKGwbW3jtq9BXGN8GJBM1i6QJK4RxotOhdJBduIFBV6Q=w600-h315-p-k" /> </a>
        <p>
            Your core values, priorities and personality traits all play a big role in increasing neuroplasticity. They motivate your behaviours but they also provide a sense of purpose and meaning.
        </p>

        <h5>Practicing mindfulness</h5>
        <p>
            Self-awareness is powerful when developing behaviours. When you are aware of your thoughts and whats happening in your brain and consciousness, the easier it is to make better meaningful decisions. This is especially important when it comes to increasing
            your neuroplasticity and changing patterns in your brain. Practicing mindful is a vital part of awakening your consciousness.

        <h4>What is Growth Mindset?</h4>
        <p>
            People who believe their skills and talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies and input from others, have growth mindset. Individuals with this mindset tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset who believe their talents
            are innate, or skills they are born with. This is because people with growth mindset spend more time learning and developing than those with a fixed mindset.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is it relevant?</h4>
        <p>
            Everyone is actually a mixture of both fixed and growth mindsets that evolves with experience, a ‘pure’ growth mindset doesn’t exist. This is relevant in our learning as we have to acknowledge the things we are already good at and also the things we’re
            not so good at, in order to receive the benefits we’re after. That way we can build on these foundations and learn to shift our weaknesses into a more positive direction.
        </p>

        <h4>In this exploration did anything surprise you? </h4>
        <p>
            I was surprised to see how much an impact a growth mindset can have on learning. Simply the knowledge that we are in fact in charge of our learning means the possibilities are far greater. Spending more time and effort into believing this will make a
            huge impact into how much faster skills can be developed.
        </p>

        <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>

        <p>
            By now understanding the true value of this mindset I will be able to change my views when comparing my progress to others. This ties in with not being comfortable sharing where my progress is, as I will now have the mindset that I will get to the same
            skill level as others by working hard and knowing I am in control of how much I can learn.
